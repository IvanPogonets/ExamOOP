# Client Relationship Management System (CRMS)

## Overview

The Client Relationship Management System (CRMS) is a Java-based console application designed to manage client information for a business. The system is built with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, providing a robust and intuitive interface for users.

## Key Objectives

- **OOP Principles**: Utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to design and implement classes effectively.
  
- **Console Interface**: Develops an intuitive console interface for seamless user interaction.

- **Data Persistence**: Implements data persistence by reading/writing client data to/from CSV/JSON files.

## Client Data Management

### Add Client

Allows users to input client details (ID, name, industry, contact person, revenue) and incorporates them into the system.

### Update Client

Enables users to change existing client details.

### Remove Client

Marks a client as inactive in the system.

### View Clients

Shows a list of all current clients with their details.

## Data Persistence

- **Read Data**: Initializes the system with client data from a CSV/JSON file.
  
- **Write Data**: Saves current client data to a CSV/JSON file upon exit.

## Search Functionality

Allows users to search for clients by name, ID, or industry.

## Technical Requirements

- **Classes and Interfaces**: Well-defined classes for Client and other relevant entities, encapsulating their properties and methods. Interfaces for shared functionalities.

- **Abstract Classes**: Usage of abstract classes where suitable.

- **File Handling**: Implementation of CSV/JSON file operations for data persistence.

- **Exception Handling**: Robust error and exception management for user inputs and file operations.

- **Data Structures**: Use of appropriate collections (like Lists, Maps) to manage and organize data.

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of classes, methods, and logic flow.

- **Source Code**: Well-organized and commented Java source files.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Adherence to OOP Principles**: Ensure OOP concepts are correctly implemented.

- **Code Quality and Organization**: Maintain clean and organized code.

- **Functionality and Correctness**: Ensure all features work as intended.

- **Error Handling and Validations**: Implement robust error handling for user inputs and file operations.

- **Documentation and Ease of Use**: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
